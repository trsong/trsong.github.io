> **Question:** In a given 2D binary array A, there are two islands.  (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s not connected to any other 1s.)
>
> Now, we may change 0s to 1s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1 island.
>
> Return the smallest number of 0s that must be flipped.  (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least 1.)

**Example 1:**
```py
Input: 
[
    [0, 1],
    [1, 0]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```py
Input: 
[
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**
```py
Input: 
[
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]
Output: 1
```
