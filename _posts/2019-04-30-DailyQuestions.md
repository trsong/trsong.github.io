## Daily Coding Problems

### Enviroment Setup
---

**Python 2.7:** [https://repl.it/languages/python](https://repl.it/languages/python)

**Java 1.8:**  TBD

<!--
### May 7, 2019 \[Hard\] Largest Sum of Non-adjacent Numbers
---

> **Question:** Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.
>
> For example, `[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]` should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. `[5, 1, 1, 5]` should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.
>
> Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?

### May 6, 2019 \[Hard\] Climb Staircase (Continued)
---

> **Question:** There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The **ORDER** of the steps matters.
>
> For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

```py
1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
```

> What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.

### May 5, 2019 \[Medium\] Climb Staircase
---

> **Question:** There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns a number represents the total number of unique ways you can climb the staircase.
>
> For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
* 1, 1, 1, 1
* 2, 1, 1
* 1, 2, 1
* 1, 1, 2
* 2, 2

### May 4, 2019 \[Easy\] Power Set
---
> **Question:** The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.
>
> For example, given the set given as a list [1, 2, 3], it should return [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]] representing the power set.

### May 3, 2019 \[Easy\] Running median of a number stream
---
> **Question:** Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.
> 
> Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.
> 
> For example, given the sequence `[2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5]`, your algorithm should print out:

```py
2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2
```

### May 2, 2019 \[Medium\] Remove K-th Last Element from Singly Linked-list
---
> **Question:** Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list.
> 
> Note:
> * The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive.
> * Do this in constant space and in one pass.

**My thoughts:** Use two pointers, faster one are k position ahead of slower one. Once faster reaches last elem, the 1st from the right. Then slow one should be (k + 1) th to the right. i.e. k + 1 - 1 = k. (fast is k position ahead of slow). 

```
k + 1 (from the right) -> k (from the right) -> k - 1 (from the right) -> .... -> 1 (from the right)
^^^^^ slow is here                                                                ^ Fast is here
```

So in order to remove the k-th last element from the list, we just need to point `slow.next` to the next of that node: `slow.next = slow.next.next`


**Python Solution:** Link: [https://repl.it/@trsong/removeKthFromEnd](https://repl.it/@trsong/removeKthFromEnd)
```py

class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, x, next=None):
        self.val = x
        self.next = next
    def __eq__(self, other):
      return not self and not other or self and other and self.next == other.next

def List(*vals):
  dummy = ListNode(-1)
  p = dummy
  for elem in vals:
    p.next = ListNode(elem)
    p = p.next
  return dummy.next  

def removeKthFromEnd(head, k):
  fast = head
  slow = head
  # Having two pointers, faster one are k posisition ahead of slower one
  for i in xrange(k):
    fast = fast.next
  # Faster pointer initially starts at position 0, and after k shift, it's null, that means, k is the length of the list.
  # So we should remove the first element from the list  
  if not fast:
    return head.next
  # Now move fast all the way until the last element in the list
  # If fast == last elem, then slow should be last k + 1 element.
  # Becasue fast is always k position ahead of slow. (k+1 - 1 == k)
  while fast and fast.next:
    fast = fast.next
    slow = slow.next

  # Remove the k-th last elem from the list
  slow.next = slow.next.next
  return head

def main():
  assert removeKthFromEnd(List(1), 1) == List()
  assert removeKthFromEnd(List(1, 2), 1) == List(1)
  assert removeKthFromEnd(List(1, 2, 3), 1) == List(1, 2)
  assert removeKthFromEnd(List(1, 2, 3), 2) == List(1, 3)
  assert removeKthFromEnd(List(1, 2, 3), 3) == List(2, 3)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

### May 1, 2019 \[Easy\] Balanced Brackets
---
> **Question:** Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).
> For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.
> Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.

**My thoughts:** Whenever there is an open bracket, there should be a corresponding close bracket. Likewise, whenver we encounter a close bracket that does not match corresponding open braket, such string is not valid.

So the idea is to iterate through the string, store all the open bracket, and whenever we see a close bracket we check and see if it matches the most rent open breaket we stored early. The data structure, **Stack**, staisfies all of our requirements.

**Python Solution:** Link: [https://repl.it/@trsong/isBalancedBrackets](https://repl.it/@trsong/isBalancedBrackets)
```py
def isBalancedBrackets(input):
  if not input:
    return True
  stack = []
  lookup = {'(':')', '[':']', '{':'}'}
  for char in input:
    # Push open bracket to stack
    if char in lookup:
      stack.append(char)

    # Pop open bracket and check if it matches corresponding close bracket  
    elif stack and char == lookup[stack[-1]]:
      stack.pop()

    # Short-circuit if open bracket not matches the counterpart
    else:
      return False

  # All char should be processed and nothing should remain in the stack    
  return not stack

def main():
  assert isBalancedBrackets("")
  assert not isBalancedBrackets(")")
  assert not isBalancedBrackets("(")
  assert not isBalancedBrackets("(]")
  assert not isBalancedBrackets("[}")
  assert not isBalancedBrackets("((]]")
  assert not isBalancedBrackets("(][)")
  assert isBalancedBrackets("(([]))")
  assert isBalancedBrackets("[]{}()")
  assert not isBalancedBrackets("())))")
  assert isBalancedBrackets("[](())")

  main()
```


### Apr 30, 2019 \[Medium\] Second Largest in BST
---

> **Questionï¼š**  Given the root to a binary search tree, find the second largest node in the tree.

**My thoughts:**
Recall the way we figure out the largest element in BST: we go all the way to the right until not possible. So the second largest element must be on the left of largest element. 
We have two possibilities here:
- Either it's the parent of rightmost element, if there is no child underneath
- Or it's the rightmost element in left subtree of the rightmost element. 

```
case 1: parent
1
 \ 
 [2]
   \
    3

case 2: rightmost of left subtree of rightmost
1
 \
  4
 /
2
 \ 
 [3] 
``` 


**Python solution:** 
Link: [https://repl.it/@trsong/secondLargestInBST](https://repl.it/@trsong/secondLargestInBST)
```py
class TreeNode(object):
  def __init__(self, x, left=None, right=None):
    self.val = x
    self.left = left
    self.right = right

def secondLargestInBST(node):
    if node is None:
      return None

    # Go all the way to the right until not possible
    # Store the second largest on the way
    secondLargest = None
    current = node
    while current.right:
      secondLargest = current
      current = current.right

    # At the rightmost element now and there exists no element between secondLargest and rightmost element
    # We have second largest already
    if current.left is None:
      return secondLargest

    # Go left and all the way to the right and the rightmost element shall be the second largest
    secondLargest = current.left
    current = current.left
    while current:
      secondLargest = current
      current = current.right
    return secondLargest

def main():
  emptyTree = None
  oneElementTree = TreeNode(1)
  leftHeavyTree1 = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(1))
  leftHeavyTree2 = TreeNode(3, TreeNode(1, right=TreeNode(2)))
  rightHeavyTree1 = TreeNode(1, right=TreeNode(2))
  rightHeavyTree2 = TreeNode(1, right=TreeNode(3, TreeNode(2)))
  balanceTree1 = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(3))
  balanceTree2 = TreeNode(6, TreeNode(5), TreeNode(7))
  balanceTree3 = TreeNode(4, balanceTree1, balanceTree2)
  sampleCase1 = TreeNode(1, right=TreeNode(2, right=TreeNode(3)))
  sampleCase2 = TreeNode(1, right=TreeNode(4, left=TreeNode(2, right=TreeNode(3))))
  assert secondLargestInBST(emptyTree) is None
  assert secondLargestInBST(oneElementTree) is None
  assert secondLargestInBST(leftHeavyTree1).val == 1
  assert secondLargestInBST(leftHeavyTree2).val == 2
  assert secondLargestInBST(rightHeavyTree1).val == 1
  assert secondLargestInBST(rightHeavyTree2).val == 2
  assert secondLargestInBST(balanceTree1).val == 2
  assert secondLargestInBST(balanceTree3).val == 6
  assert secondLargestInBST(sampleCase1).val == 2
  assert secondLargestInBST(sampleCase2).val == 3

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
