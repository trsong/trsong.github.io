</summary>
<div>

**Question:** Given Postorder and Inorder traversals, construct the tree.

**Examples 1:**
```py
Input: 
in_order = [2, 1, 3]
post_order = [2, 3, 1]

Output: 
      1
    /   \
   2     3 
```

**Example 2:**
```py
Input: 
in_order = [4, 8, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7]
post_order = [8, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1]

Output:
          1

</summary>
<div>

**Question:** Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.

For example, given the following preorder traversal:

```py
[a, b, d, e, c, f, g]
```

And the following inorder traversal:

```py
[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]
```

You should return the following tree:

```py
    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \
d  e f  g
```

- [**\[Medium\] The Celebrity Problem**](https://trsong.github.io/python/java/2020/05/02/DailyQuestionsMay/#jul-27-2020-medium-the-celebrity-problem) -- *Given a list of N people and the above operation, find a way to identify the celebrity in O(N) time.* [*\(Try ME\)*](https://repl.it/@trsong/Test-The-Celebrity-Problem)

</summary>
<div>

**Question:** At a party, there is a single person who everyone knows, but who does not know anyone in return (the "celebrity"). To help figure out who this is, you have access to an `O(1)` method called `knows(a, b)`, which returns `True` if person `a` knows person `b`, else `False`.

Given a list of `N` people and the above operation, find a way to identify the celebrity in `O(N)` time.
