**Question:** Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

**Example:**
```py
Consider the following matrix:

[
  [ 1,  4,  7, 11, 15],
  [ 2,  5,  8, 12, 19],
  [ 3,  6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
Given target = 5, return True.
Given target = 20, return False.
```
