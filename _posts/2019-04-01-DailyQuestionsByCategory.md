**Question:** Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.

For example, given the following preorder traversal:

```py
[a, b, d, e, c, f, g]
```

And the following inorder traversal:

```py
[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]
```

You should return the following tree:

```py
    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \

</summary>
<div>

**Question:** At a party, there is a single person who everyone knows, but who does not know anyone in return (the "celebrity"). To help figure out who this is, you have access to an `O(1)` method called `knows(a, b)`, which returns `True` if person `a` knows person `b`, else `False`.

Given a list of `N` people and the above operation, find a way to identify the celebrity in `O(N)` time.

</summary>
<div>

**Question:** Given a positive integer `N`, find the smallest number of steps it will take to reach `1`.

There are two kinds of permitted steps:
- You may decrement `N` to `N - 1`.
- If `a * b = N`, you may decrement `N` to the larger of `a` and `b`.
 
For example, given `100`, you can reach `1` in five steps with the following route: `100 -> 10 -> 9 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`.

</summary>
<div>

**Question:** Given a string of digits, generate all possible valid IP address combinations.

IP addresses must follow the format A.B.C.D, where A, B, C, and D are numbers between `0` and `255`. Zero-prefixed numbers, such as `01` and `065`, are not allowed, except for `0` itself.

For example, given `"2542540123"`, you should return `['254.25.40.123', '254.254.0.123']`
