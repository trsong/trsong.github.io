### Aug 2, 2021 \[Hard\] Exclusive Product
---
> **Question:**  Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
>
> For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

> Follow-up: what if you can't use division?


### Aug 1, 2021 \[Hard\] Order of Course Prerequisites
---
> **Question:** We're given a hashmap associating each courseId key with a list of courseIds values, which represents that the prerequisites of courseId are courseIds. Return a sorted ordering of courses such that we can finish all courses.
>
> Return null if there is no such ordering.
>
> For example, given `{'CSC300': ['CSC100', 'CSC200'], 'CSC200': ['CSC100'], 'CSC100': []}`, should return `['CSC100', 'CSC200', 'CSC300']`.
