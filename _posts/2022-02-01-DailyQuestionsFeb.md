### Feb 1, 2022 \[Medium\] Maximum Path Sum in Binary Tree
--- 
> **Question:** You are given the root of a binary tree. Find the path between 2 nodes that maximizes the sum of all the nodes in the path, and return the sum. The path does not necessarily need to go through the root.

**Example:**
```py
Given the following binary tree, the result should be 42 = 20 + 2 + 10 + 10.
       *10
       /  \
     *2   *10
     / \     \
   *20  1    -25
             /  \
            3    4
(* denotes the max path)
```
