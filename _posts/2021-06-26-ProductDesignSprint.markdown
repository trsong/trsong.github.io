### Before the Sprint
---
- Great ideas from heads-down individuals not Groups
- Good-but-not-greate ideas through Groups consensus

#### Get Right People

**Must Have:**
- Designer 
- CEO: decision making and get actionable solution
- PM: implement solution
- User expert: direct contact with customer
  
**Nice to Have:**
- Engineer
- Maketer
- Interested Individuals

#### Do Right Things

- User Study, before jump in design
- Name the facilitator: who cooridanate the sprint and meetings and so on
- Put it on the calendar: get clear 5 consecutive days for everyone


### Day 1: Understand
---
**Goal:** Encourage everyone to share knowledge and bring the rest to the same table

#### Building understanding exercises

- For each exercise constantly share *"How might we ..."*
- Business opporunitiy: product leader walk through market
- Look at competitor's products
- Look at non-competitive products in similar domain or solve similar question
- Print all important UI mocks of our product
- Success metrics
- Share existing user research
- Interview notes from relevent domain
- Existing analytics
- IMPORTANT: sketch the most important user story

#### Checklist to prepare for prototype
- When to present prototype to user?
- What to hope to learn from prototype?
- What do you need to design and prototype in order to learn?


### Day 2: Diverge
---
**Goal:** Illuminate all of the possible paths

- This is not brainstorming idea. Don't work in groups
- Everyone working quielty and individually
- Ok to have old ideas
- Divide and conquer. Pick up a piece of the story to focus


### Day 3: Decide
---
**Goal:** tough decision to make: which solution to pursue and which to put on ice?

- CEO sometimes have to be blunt and make decision
- search for conclicts: different approaches to the same problem

#### Next Step Prototpe: Best Shot or Battle Royale
- Battle Royale: prototype on different approaches and test against each other
- Best Shot: go with a single prototype
- Or 3rd route: Hybrid model

#### Checklist to parepare for prototype
- List underlying assumptions
- Whiteboard the user story
- Best shot or battle royal?


### Day 4: Prototype
---
- Minimally real
- Use real text for core UI text
- Keynote/PPT Slide 90% time is sufficient than Code
  - Fast
  - Easy to look good: excellent animation make it more real
  - Anybody can use and not expensive to build
  - Easy to share
  - Easy to make change in the future
- Use Keynotopia UI Prototype Template to speed up prototype
- Divide and Concquer: split stask and work with others
- Lightning critique midday (eg. 5 min): to ensure consistency
- Review with outsiders
- Let engineer know the code is THROWAWAY. 
- It's ok to be imperfect.


### Day 5: Validate
---
Get real outsider user to test product

#### List Key Questions
- Review conflicts and assumptions
- Indictate if battle royale
- Show observers real product for comparison
- Think beyond the prototype and get unexpected insights
- Don't diss the dumb user
- Designate a interview transcript reporter

#### Potential Comments
- *"First impression: geniuses or idiots".* People are different. No action required.
- *"Oh, this is complicated ..."* Watch how people suffer and learn from it
- *"There is a pattern!"*. Write down things that work vs problem need to solve.

#### Next Sprint
What's action item for next sprint, pick one:
- Tune existing protoype and keep working
- Go back to step 2 diverge and come up with more solutions
- Go back to step 1 understand and understand why this sprint failed

**Note:** Last but not least, CEO appreciate that they have a clear list of action items. No effort is wasted. Next sprint move more quickly or with less effort.
