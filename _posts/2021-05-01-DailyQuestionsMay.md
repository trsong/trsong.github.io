## Daily Coding Problems

### Enviroment Setup
---

**Python 2.7 Playground:** [https://repl.it/languages/python](https://repl.it/languages/python)

**Python 3 Playground:** [https://repl.it/languages/python3](https://repl.it/languages/python3) 

**Java Playground:** [https://repl.it/languages/java](https://repl.it/languages/java)


### May 3, 2021 \[Easy\] Find Duplicates
---
> **Question:** Given an array of size n, and all values in the array are in the range 1 to n, find all the duplicates.

**Example:**
```py
Input: [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1]
Output: [2, 3]
```

### May 2, 2021 \[Hard\] Increasing Subsequence of Length K
---
> **Question:** Given an int array nums of length n and an int k. Return an increasing subsequence of length k (KIS). Expected time complexity `O(nlogk)`.

**Example 1:**
```py
Input: nums = [10, 1, 4, 8, 2, 9], k = 3
Output: [1, 4, 8] or [1, 4, 9] or [1, 8, 9]
```

**Example 2:**
```py
Input: nums = [10, 1, 4, 8, 2, 9], k = 4
Output: [1, 4, 8, 9]
```


### May 1, 2021 \[Hard\] Decreasing Subsequences
---
> **Question:** Given an int array nums of length n. Split it into strictly decreasing subsequences. Output the min number of subsequences you can get by splitting.

**Example 1:**
```py
Input: [5, 2, 4, 3, 1, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
You can split this array into: [5, 2, 1], [4, 3], [6]. And there are 3 subsequences you get.
Or you can split it into [5, 4, 3], [2, 1], [6]. Also 3 subsequences.
But [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [6] is not legal because [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] is not a subsuquence of the original array.
```

**Example 2:**
```py
Input: [2, 9, 12, 13, 4, 7, 6, 5, 10]
Output: 4
Explanation: [2], [9, 4], [12, 10], [13, 7, 6, 5]
```

**Example 3:**
```py
Input: [1, 1, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Because of the strictly descending order you have to split it into 3 subsequences: [1], [1], [1]
```

**My thoughts:** This question is equivalent to [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://trsong.github.io/python/java/2020/05/02/DailyQuestionsMay/#june-19-2020-lc-300-hard-the-longest-increasing-subsequence). Can be solved with greedy approach.

Imagine we are to create a list of stacks each in descending order (stack top is smallest). And those stacks are sorted by each stack's top element. 

Then for each element from input sequence, we just need to figure out (using binary search) the stack such that by pushing this element into stack, result won't affect the order of stacks and decending property of each stack. 

Finally, the total number of stacks equal to min number of subsequence we can get by splitting. Each stack represents a decreasing subsequence.

**Greedy Solution with Descending Stack and Binary Search:** [https://replit.com/@trsong/Decreasing-Subsequences](https://replit.com/@trsong/Decreasing-Subsequences)
```py
import unittest

def min_decreasing_subsequences(sequence):
    # maintain a list of descending stacks sorted by each stack top 
    stack_list = []
    for num in sequence:
        stack_index = binary_search_stack_top(stack_list, num)
        if stack_index == len(stack_list):
            stack_list.append([])
        stack_list[stack_index].append(num)
    return len(stack_list)


def binary_search_stack_top(stack_list, target):
    lo = 0
    hi = len(stack_list)
    while lo < hi:
        mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2
        stack_top = stack_list[mid][-1]
        if stack_top <= target:
            lo = mid + 1
        else:
            hi = mid
    return lo
